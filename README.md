## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
-   Flexbox
-   Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next generation frontend tooling

### What I learned

I'm particularly proud of how I used radio buttons to track the selected rating instead of implementing some complex state management and a lot of DOM manipulations. At first I was thinking of bringing a lightweight DOM library like [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/), but then I remembered that forms can track state and went for a simple solution.

### Useful resources

There's a Stack Overflow thread I used to help me style a label based on the state of the radio input button it's linked to. You can check out the thread [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4641752/css-how-to-style-a-selected-radio-buttons-label)
